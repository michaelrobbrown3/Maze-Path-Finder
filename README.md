# A* Pathfinding Project

A Python project demonstrating the **A\*** pathfinding algorithm navigating dynamic, randomly generated mazes. Interactive visualizations show the pathfinding process in real time, with obstacle updates and step-by-step path tracing.

---

## Features

- Implements **A\*** algorithm for efficient pathfinding.
- Dynamic mazes with **random obstacles** that can be added or removed in real time.
- Interactive visualizations tracing the computed path and algorithm steps.
- Helps understand algorithmic decision-making and applications in autonomous navigation systems.

## Demo

*The circle moves from start (green) to end (red). Red dots mark already traversed squares.*

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/michaelrobbrown3/Maze-Path-Finder.git
```

2. **Navigate to the project folder:**

```bash
cd Maze-Path-Finder
```

3. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Run the project:**

```bash
python src/main.py
```

## How it Works

The program uses the **A*** algorithm to calculate the shortest path from start to finish in a grid. The visualization updates in real time as obstacles are added or removed, showing the path recalculation process step by step.

- Add or remove wall by clicking on the squares.
- Click the circle to start it on its journey.
- Click the red (end) square to stop the program.
