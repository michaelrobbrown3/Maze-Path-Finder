# Maze-Path-Finder
Python project showcasing the A pathfinding algorithm. Navigate dynamic, randomly generated mazes with real-time obstacle updates. Interactive visualizations trace the path and steps as the algorithm finds its way from start to finish.




# A* Pathfinding Project

A Python project demonstrating the **A\*** pathfinding algorithm navigating dynamic, randomly generated mazes. Interactive visualizations show the pathfinding process in real time, with obstacle updates and step-by-step path tracing.

## Features

- Implements **A\*** algorithm for efficient pathfinding.
- Dynamic mazes with **random obstacles** that can be added or removed in real time.
- Interactive visualizations tracing the computed path and algorithm steps.
- Helps understand algorithmic decision-making and applications in autonomous navigation systems.
